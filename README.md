# Whistleblower Steganography
## Intentions/目标
Use steganography to hide a Chinese interview article in a PNG file.

将《人物》杂志文章《发哨子的人》隐写入PNG图片。

## How to Use/使用方法
You can take `joshua_tree.png` as a CTF challenge...

你可以将`joshua_tree.png`当作一个CTF/夺旗赛问题……

...or just run `python3 whistleblower_decode.py` in your terminal. The interview file will go directly into `decode_text.txt` in your current directory.

……或者可以直接在终端运行`python3 whistleblower_decode.py`。《发哨子的人》将被保存在当前目录下的`decode_text.txt`文件中。

Well, the PNG file is a bit large :)
额，PNG图片有点大~跑的时候耐心点:)

## Hint/提示
LSB steganography. Pretty much too easy to be a CTF challenge.
最低有效位隐写，实在是很简单的CTF问题啦……
